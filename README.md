# Stack-Overflow-Copy

## A QA website similar to StackOverflow, where users can ask and answer questions regarding a certain topic.
- A main page which contains a list of recent questions, each 10 questions appear in together (pagination), then the next page contains the next 10 questions…etc.
- Registered users should be able to post a question.
- Registered users should be able to answer a question.
- Each question has a list of tags, when a user clicks on a tag, he should be directed to a page containing all the questions related to this tag.
- Each question page starts with the Title of the question, the body (description), the tags, (all are under each other in a vertical way, please take a look at an example on stackoverflow) then a list of answers, Users can also comment on questions and answers.
- Users can sort the questions based on: 1-Newest, 2-Most answers 3-Top Questions of the day (question with most answers among the questions that were posted in the last 24 hours)
- Each question and answer can have a number of votes, where users can either upvote or downvote them, users can’t vote on their own questions and answers.
- Each user has a reputation that appear next to his name, each time a user gets an upvote he gets 5 reputations, a downvote remove 5 reputations.
- Comments and answers should appear in a vertical way under their targeted questions, just like real QA websites.
- Create a system to assign badges to users, for example, a user with 100 reputations will get a golden badge that appears next to his name.
- The user who asked the question can mark an answer as the accepted answer.
